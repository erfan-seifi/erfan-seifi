# Hi there, I'm Erfan Seifi ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a data scientist with a passion for machine learning, software engineering, and embedded systems. I enjoy working on projects involving computer vision and time series analysis.

More specifically I am motivated to work with AI models (including Generative models, LLMS, Real Time Object Detection & Tracking) and apply them to the web applications.
